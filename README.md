# IoT-based Poultry Farm Water and Feed Level Monitoring

## Overview

This Arduino sketch represents a collaborative school group project that originally aimed to create an IoT-based solution for monitoring water and feed levels in a poultry farm. The project involved controlling a servo motor and collecting data from ultrasonic sensors. Additionally, it featured integration with the Blynk platform for remote monitoring and control.

Please note that as of the current status of this repository:
- The physical prototype associated with this project no longer exists; it was decommissioned and disposed of.
- The Blynk configuration is set to a past group member's account, for which I no longer have access.

## Key Features

- **Servo Motor Control:** The code allows for the control of a servo motor, which could be used for various automated functions.
- **Ultrasonic Sensors:** Ultrasonic sensors are employed to measure distances, facilitating the monitoring of water and feed levels.
- **Blynk Integration:** Originally, the project featured integration with the Blynk platform for remote monitoring and control. Please note that the Blynk configuration in this repository is no longer actively maintained or accessible.

## How This Project Benefits Me Professionally

While the physical prototype and Blynk integration are no longer available, this project still holds value in my portfolio for the following reasons:

1. **Technical Skills:** The project enhanced my skills in hardware and software development, particularly in working with Arduino, sensors, and motors.

2. **Problem-Solving:** It highlights my ability to tackle real-world challenges and design solutions.

3. **Teamwork:** Mentioning that this was a school group project underscores my experience in collaborative work, an essential skill in many professional settings.


I am committed to continuous learning and growth, and I look forward to applying and expanding upon the skills and knowledge gained through this project in my future endeavors.
